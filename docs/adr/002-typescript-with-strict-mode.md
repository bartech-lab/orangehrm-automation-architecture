# ADR 002: TypeScript with Strict Mode

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We need type safety to catch errors early and improve developer experience.

**Decision**: Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.

**Consequences**:

- ✅ Compile-time error checking
- ✅ Better IDE support and autocompletion
- ✅ Self-documenting code through types
- ❌ Slightly longer development time
